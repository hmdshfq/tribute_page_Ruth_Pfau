            "Dr Ruth Pfau may have been born in Germany, [but] her heart was
            always in Pakistan. She came here at the dawn of a young nation
            looking to make lives better for those afflicted by disease and in
            doing so found herself a home. We will remember her for her courage,
            her loyalty, her service to the eradication of leprosy and most of
            all her patriotism."
